/*
 * Design and implement a new rule variant for when the dealer should take one
 * more card. The new variant is “Soft 17″, use the same design pattern already
 * present for Hit. Soft 17 means that the dealer has 17 but in a combination of
 * Ace and 6 (for example Ace, two, two, two). This means that the Dealer can
 * get another card valued at 10 but still have 17 as the value of the ace is
 * reduced to 1. Using the soft 17 rule the dealer should take another card
 * (compared to the original rule when the dealer only takes cards on a score of
 * 16 or lower).
